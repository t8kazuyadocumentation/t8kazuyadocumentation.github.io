Although Kazuya's movelist is not incredibly long compared to some other characters, he has a small variety of moves that can be used in different ways, allowing you to play Kazuya however you want. In general, though, Kazuya has certain moves that differentiate him from the cast and make him strong in the right hands.




very messy info dump for now (to be formatted later):

ewgf (pressure tool, launcher, keepout)
1,1,2 (hitconfirmable punish/checking tool [knd])
df2 (ch tool and homing mid)
ff4 (oki tool and ch mid)
df4,4 (mid safe poking big dmg hitconfirm is crazy)
ff2 (bro)
f4 (quick mid with +4 frame on block, guaranteed ff4 on ch cuz of knd)
db4 (great low with plus frame on hit, decent tracking also)
cd4,1 (evil rage inducing fast low, core mixup tool from wavedash)
ff3 (nh mid launcher, core mixup tool from wavedash also)
b1+2 (backsway, safe on block, mid, chip dmg, heat engager LMAO (better used when at range 2 or 3 on read kind of as ch keepout in a way, not as good as t7 variant when u can use it point blank imo)
d1+2 (evil high crush ch launching low, can be canceled with b input into goofy shit like ws2 lmao)
db1,2 (i13 good range block punisher and whiff punisher + heat engager + combo ender for wall carry [DO NOT GET BLOCKED THIS SHIT IS -19 HOLY MOLY])
ss1+2 (plus 5 on block mid, many poeple will mash after blockign because its new tool. hence df2 after it is clean usually also has built in evasion some)
ff1+2/uf1+2 (at wall esp, wallsplatting grab)
b1,2 (good range i11 block and whiff punisher)
ws1,2 (i13 low launcher, very crucial to what makes kazuya who he is: The punishment/defensive mishima can whiff on many -13 lows though be careful)
f3 (kinda like a bootleg jin f4 but no combo on ch. decent range mid keepout/can use for deathfist punish etc if you dont wanna do dewgf or something)
